    <h2>Questions:</h2>
	<p>I like using GitHub pages because I can update the page by pushing my changes instead of reuploading new files.
		I like using cPanel hosting because the site tools offer a lot of options but are still relatively easy to understand and use.</p>
	<p>The most satisfying part of this assignment was refreshing the page and seeing things look as I expected.</p>
